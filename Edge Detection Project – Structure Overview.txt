Project Description

This project is a .NET Console Application developed for performing Edge Detection using OpenCV image processing library.
The architecture is built with a multi-layer structure to ensure clean separation of concerns, scalability, and easy testing.

Project Layers

Domain Layer
Contains the core entities such as InputImage that represent the image data and related domain models.

Application Layer
Includes services, mappers, and logic responsible for applying OpenCV-based edge detection and mapping input data.

Infrastructure Layer
Handles file operations — loading, saving, and managing images.

Presentation Layer
The main console application (Program.cs) that acts as the entry point for running image detection tasks.

Tests Layer
Contains unit and integration tests for validating mapping and OpenCV processing functionality.
